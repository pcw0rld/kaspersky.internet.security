## How Kaspersky Internet Security Remove Malware ?

**Kaspersky Internet Security** scans all files and folders on your desktop. If it detects any malware or threat, it uploads the file to the Cloud for further analysis. Until you get the results, the file remains under quarantine. Users can easily access the files and return them to their original folder once they are free of malware. 

In addition to this, **Kaspersky Internet Security** also cleans your PC. It removes outdated software and gets rid of files that may be slowing down the system. It even regularly checks the available logs and temporary files and removes them when required. However, of course, this feature requires user input before deleting anything that it flags.
